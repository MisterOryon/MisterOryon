## Hi there 👋, I'm **MisterOryon** 👋 

* Computer science student, probably diving into a thesis next year—it's crazy how a thesis can seem more appealing than a date! 🧐
* Always tinkering with something, probably some Go code (because yes, I loooove Go!) 🥋
* Between bugs, you'll find me solving logical puzzles, but never enjoying a good cup of coffee (I hate coffee, it's our secret) ☕
* Oh, and by the way, I use Arch btw. Not that I like to brag... oh wait, yes I do! 🐧
