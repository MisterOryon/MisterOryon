## Hi there 👋, I'm **MisterOryon** 👋 

* Computer science student, probably diving into a thesis next year—it's crazy how a thesis can seem more appealing than a date! 🧐
* Always tinkering with something, probably some Go code (because yes, I loooove Go!) 🥋
* Between bugs, you'll find me solving logical puzzles, but never enjoying a good cup of coffee (I hate coffee, it's our secret) ☕
* Oh, and by the way, I use Arch. Not that I like to brag... oh wait, yes I do! 🐧

### I Love Open Source

Dedicated to engineering integrity. Open source is a collaborative human achievement, now threatened by unverified AI-generated content. I oppose the surge of low-quality contributions that increase maintenance burdens and degrade software stability. Quality over automation. 🛡️
